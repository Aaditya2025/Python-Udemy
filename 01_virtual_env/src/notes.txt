Common commands
1. Create a virtual environment:  "python -m venv myenv"
2. Activate it
    Windows:  myenv\Scripts\activate
    Mac/Linux: source myenv/bin/activate
3. Deactivate it: deactivate


Example scenario:
Project A needs Django 3.2
Project B needs Django 5.0
→ You create two separate virtual environments, each with its own Django version, without conflicts.

So, a virtual environment is basically a project-specific Python setup containing its own installed packages, keeping everything clean and conflict-free.

THIS IS THE TRADITIONAL WAY TO CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND USE IT.
